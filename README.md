# Master Server using gRPC

**Please note that this Code is almost 2 years old**

This was my first attempt to gRPC. On `Frostvein` (my OpenNos Fork) i reworked the Master Server using gRPC.

I uploaded it to share the code (even though its not great) and to check out/safe my learning curve. Might do that more with cool stuff i did.
