# Master Server using gRPC

**Please note that this Code is almost 2 years old**

This was my first attempt to gRPC. On Frostvein (my OpenNos Fork) i reworked the Master Server (called it Communication Server, why ever..) and used gRPC.

I uploaded it to share the code (even though its not great) and give you the idea on how gRPC works.
